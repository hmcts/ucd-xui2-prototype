# ucd-xui2-prototype
xui prototype version 2 - Common components team

This is intended as an evolution of xui-prototype, to enable a clean base keeping up to date with the latest version of the GDS prototype kit.

The prototype is for the common components UCD team to build out journeys as required and to provide more consistency across journeys for user testing.

Please insure that this repository is always on the latest GDS prototype kit version. 
Instructions for updating the kit can be found here: https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/updating-the-kit
